# AI-Driven Selenium Test Generator

## Problem
Traditional QA requires manual creation of test cases and automation scripts,
which is slow and error-prone.

## AI-First Solution
This project uses Generative AI to:
- Convert user stories into test scenarios
- Automatically generate Selenium automation scripts
- Accelerate test design and improve coverage

## Architecture
User Story → GenAI → Selenium + PyTest → Automated Execution

## Technologies
- Python
- Selenium
- PyTest
- OpenAI (GenAI)

## How to Run
1. Add your OpenAI API key
2. Provide a user story
3. Run the generator
4. Execute generated Selenium tests

## Key Learning
This project demonstrates an AI-first QA mindset where AI leads test design,
and engineers focus on validation and improvement.
